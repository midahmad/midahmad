# Hi there, I’m Mida 👋

💡 A curious learner with a heart for **public health**, a passion for **data**, and a love for stories that connect us.

🌱 Currently learning:
- Data analysis with **R & Python**
- Public health informatics and data storytelling
- How to turn insights into meaningful impact

💻 Projects I care about:
- 📊 Community health data dashboards
- 🤝 Behavior change & health promotion programs
- 🌏 Cross-cultural collaboration through digital tools

🍃 When I’m not working with data, you’ll find me:
- Wandering through quiet parks & scenic routes
- Writing letters on the Slowly app ✉️
- Reading about human behavior, or just stargazing ☁️🌙

> _"Small stories, quiet numbers, and kind letters can change the world."_  

Thanks for stopping by 💛
